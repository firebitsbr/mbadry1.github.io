For people who are already familiar with programming and want to lean Perl language on the run, here are a very good start "http://sandbox.mc.edu/~bennet/perl/leccode/index.html".

Just install Perl and your any editor or IDE and then try the examples. This way you will learn about the syntax and whats going on faster than reading a book or taking a course.
